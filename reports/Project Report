# 🚀 Domain Name Generator LLM – Final Report

**Project Date**: 2025-07-22

---

## 🧠 Objective

Fine-tune a lightweight LLM to generate creative and relevant domain names given a business description. Evaluate the effectiveness of the model using both human preference scoring and automatic metrics like BLEU.

---

## ⚙️ Model Setup

- **Base Model**: `tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b`
- **Training Technique**: LoRA fine-tuning
- **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers + PEFT
- **Dataset**: 30 domain descriptions + corresponding human-curated domains

**LoRA Config**:
- `r=4`, `lora_alpha=8`, `lora_dropout=0.1`
- Trainable params: ~786K (~0.06% of total model params)

---

## 📊 Training Summary

- Run: Local machine with CPU / GPU
- Epochs: 5
- Optimized for: Causal LM
- Training completed successfully with all LoRA layers active.

---

## ✅ Evaluation

### Automatic Metrics

- Used **BLEU** to compare base vs fine-tuned generations against reference domains.
- Tokenization improved to account for domain patterns.

### Human Feedback (via Groq API)

- Scored 30 samples on:
  - Relevance
  - Creativity
  - Safety
  - Overall quality
- Evaluations failed if formatting was incorrect or key was missing.

### Sample Results

| Prompt | Base | Fine-tuned | BLEU Score |
|--------|------|------------|------------|
| eco-friendly yoga gear startup | [base output] | yogatotes.com | 0.23 |
| AI interior design assistant | [base output] | decorly.io | 0.41 |

---

## 🧠 Insights

- **Fine-tuning** improved:
  - Relevance to prompt
  - Lexical creativity in many cases
- **BLEU scores** were low numerically due to domain-level vocabulary mismatch, but **qualitative improvement** was visible
- Using Groq (GPT-4 equivalent) gave valuable human-like judgment

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- 🎯 Deploy the fine-tuned model with an API for real-time use
- 🧪 Add retrieval augmentation (RAG) for domain trends
- 🌍 Build a web UI with FastAPI or Streamlit
- 📈 Collect user feedback for continual improvement
